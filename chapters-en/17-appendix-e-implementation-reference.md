# Appendix E: Implementation Reference

> **Purpose:** Operational artifacts for teams implementing MLSecOps in production. This appendix is **not** production code or vendor-specific IaC. It complements the reference chapters with architecture cards, decision matrices, fill-in templates, playbooks, and a master control matrix.
>
> **Relationship to other appendices:** Appendix A/B summarize threat and ATLAS mappings; Appendix D covers managed AI checklists. This appendix ties them to **your architecture choice**.

> *Refs - This guide: [Traceability convention](15-conclusion-appendix.md#traceability-and-source-mapping-convention) (Chapter 15); [Master control matrix](#e6-master-control-matrix) maps to [lifecycle control points](06-pipeline.md#lifecycle-control-points) (Chapter 6). Author note: Architecture cards, templates, and matrices are operational aids - not normative standard text.*

## E.1 Architecture Cards

Each card lists minimum security boundaries, primary control points ([Chapter 6](06-pipeline.md)), and deep-dive chapters. Adapt names and namespaces to your environment.

### E.1.1 Enterprise RAG (internal knowledge base)

**When to use:** Organization-owned documents retrieved at query time; model may be managed API or self-hosted.

![](../assets/diagrams/17-appendix-e-implementation-reference_01.png)

*Figure - Enterprise RAG architecture card, showing the ingest, retrieval, runtime, and re-index security boundaries for an internal knowledge base.*

|---|---|---|---|
| Ingest | Allowlist sources, PII scan, hash per document version | 2, 3, 4 | [Ch.7 ingest](07-llm-rag-security.md#ingest-security-in-rag) |
| Retrieval | Tenant ACL at query time, no cross-tenant index | 7, 10 | [Ch.7 three-layer](07-llm-rag-security.md#three-layer-controls-in-rag) |

---

### E.1.6 Classic ML (tabular / vision — no LLM)

**When to use:** Traditional training pipeline; no prompt/RAG/agent surface.

| Area | Minimum controls | Control points | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data | Lineage, PII, poison checks | 2, 4 | [Ch.4](04-data-security-privacy.md) |
| Model | ModelScan, adversarial test for modality | 3, 7 | [Ch.5](05-model-artifact-supply-chain.md) |
| Release | Sign artifacts, Evidence Pack | 8, 9 | [Ch.6](06-pipeline.md), [Ch.11](11-governance-evidence.md) |

> **Out of scope:** These cards assume the organization **consumes or serves** a model. **Pretraining or fine-tuning your own foundation model** (large-scale data curation, training-compute integrity, base-model evaluation and release) is a distinct topology not covered by a dedicated card here; apply Chapters 4-6 controls and treat it as a separate assessment.

> *Refs - Frameworks: NIST AI RMF: Map (architecture-dependent controls); OWASP LLM Top 10 / ASI / MCP themes per card. This guide: Architecture cards E.1.1-E.1.6 cross-link Chapters 2, 4-8, 10-11, 16, and [Appendix D](15-conclusion-appendix.md#appendix-d-managed-ai-services-security-reference). Author note: Cards are fill-in operational patterns - not normative standard text.*

## E.2 Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to select **mandatory control themes** by architecture. Map each row to control points in [Chapter 6](06-pipeline.md) and evidence in E.4.

| If your primary architecture is… | You must prioritize… | Blocking release decisions at… | Integrity evidence at… | Start chapters |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Managed AI API only** | Gateway, DLP, config snapshot, Shadow AI policy | 4 (data in prompts/RAG), 7 (injection/leak tests), 8 | 9 (deployment ID, region, config hash—not weight signature) | Ch.2, 7, Appendix D |
| **Enterprise RAG** | Ingest ACL, retrieval ACL, reindex playbook, output gate | 4 (poisoned corpus), 7 (RAG leakage tests), 8 | 9 (index version hash + model/config evidence) | Ch.4, 7 |
| **Self-hosted LLM** | Model scan, signing, K8s isolation, admission verify | 4, 7, 8 | 9 (signature + attestation) | Ch.5, 6, 16 |
| **Agent + MCP** | Intent Gate, tool allowlist, MCP scan, HITL | 7 (tool misuse tests), 8 | 9 (agent config + tool manifest hash) | Ch.7, 8 |
| **Multi-agent** | Delegation policy, session trace, bus isolation | 7, 8 | 9 + inter-agent policy version | Ch.8, 10 |
| **Classic ML** | Data validation, adversarial test, signing | 4, 7, 8 | 9 (model signature) | Ch.4, 5, 6 |

**Reference implementation flow (implementation-neutral):**

Organizations often implement the lifecycle through existing delivery tooling. A typical **pattern** (not a mandated stack):

![](../assets/diagrams/17-appendix-e-implementation-reference_06.png)

*Figure - Implementation-neutral reference flow, mapping lifecycle stages (change trigger, scan, security validation, policy decision, Evidence Pack, deploy) to control points through existing delivery tooling.*

| Stage | Example capabilities (informative) | Control points |
|---|---|---|
| Change trigger | GitLab/GitHub merge, ticket, scheduled CT | 1 |
| Scan layer | Gitleaks, Trivy, ModelScan | 2, 3 |
| Security validation | Garak, Promptfoo, ART (by modality) | 7 |
| Policy decision | OPA/Conftest, GRC workflow | 4, 8 |
| Evidence Pack | JSON bundle, GRC record, registry metadata | 8, 9, 10 |
| Deploy | Canary, signed image verify, gateway policy version | 9, 10 |

> This guide does not ship CI/CD templates. Implement and test flows in your environment. Tool examples: [Chapter 12 appendix](12-threat-control-tools-map.md#appendix-informative-tool-command-reference).

## E.3 Threat Model Template

Copy this table per system or architecture card. Replace placeholders. Output should feed control point criteria and Evidence Pack requirements ([Chapter 2](02-scope-risk-threat-model.md#expected-output-of-threat-modeling)).

**System:** _________________________ **Architecture card:** _________________________ **Date / version:** _________

| Asset | Threat (STRIDE / OWASP / ATLAS ref) | Control (prevent / detect / respond) | Lifecycle control point(s) | Residual risk (accept / mitigate / transfer) | Evidence required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Training dataset | e.g. `Data Poisoning`, `ML02` | Validation, lineage, PII mask | 2, 3, 4 | | Scan report, lineage ID |
| Model weights | e.g. backdoor, unsigned swap | ModelScan, signing | 3, 7, 9 | | Hash, signature verify log |
| RAG index | e.g. `Retrieval Poisoning` | Ingest ACL, reindex playbook | 4, 5, 7 | | Index version hash |
| Prompt / system instructions | e.g. `LLM01` injection | Gateway, guardrails, red team | 7, 10 | | Test report URI |
| Agent tools / MCP | e.g. `ASI02`, `MCP09` | Intent Gate, allowlist, scan | 3, 7, 10 | | Tool manifest hash, scan PDF |
| API keys / secrets | e.g. exposure in agent trace | Vault, proxy, rotation | 3, 10 | | Secret scan clean, rotation log |
| Inference endpoint | e.g. model theft, GPU abuse | AuthN/Z, rate limit, Falco | 10 | | Access log sample |
| Managed API config | e.g. wrong region/model ID | Config review, snapshot | 5, 8, 9 | | `config_snapshot_hash` |

**Release blockers (define explicitly):**

- [ ] Unmasked PII in training or RAG ingest → block at control point **4**
- [ ] Security validation below threat-model threshold → block at **7**
- [ ] Policy/compliance review failed → block at **8**
- [ ] Missing signature or config snapshot → block at **9**

## Practical summary

1. Pick an **architecture card** (E.1) and confirm rows in the **decision matrix** (E.2).
2. Complete the **threat model template** (E.3) and define release blockers at control points 4, 7, 8, 9.
3. Instantiate the **Evidence Pack template** (E.4) in your GRC or registry workflow.
4. Wire **playbooks** (E.5) into SOC runbooks and on-call.
5. Use the **master control matrix** (E.6) for design review and gap analysis against [Chapter 12](12-threat-control-tools-map.md).

This appendix does not add new normative requirements beyond the lifecycle model in [Chapter 6](06-pipeline.md). It packages existing guidance for production implementation.
