# Chapter 14: MLSecOps Maturity Roadmap

## Why Phased Maturity Matters

Implementing full `MLSecOps` in a single phase is usually impractical. Teams must progress based on their risk, capacity, and architecture. The maturity roadmap helps an organization start with foundational controls and gradually reach an auditable, operational architecture.

## Maturity Levels

| Level | Status | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| Level 0 | No coherent controls | Models are built and released manually; evidence is scarce. |
| Level 1 | Foundational | Threat model, data validation, artifact scan, and team awareness are in place. |
| Level 2 | Operational | Automated gates, signing, security testing, runtime telemetry, and SOC runbook exist. |
| Level 3 | Mature | Automated evidence, advanced SOC, tamper-evident storage, multi-tenant hardening, and regression score are in place. |

## Level 1: Foundational

The goal of Level 1 is to prevent fundamental errors before entering `Production`. The entry criterion for this level is implementation of a minimum baseline.

| Capability | Readiness Criterion |
|---|---|
| `Threat Model` and planning | `ATLAS/OWASP` document before the first pipeline |
| `Data Validation` | Schema and PII check before train |
| Artifact scan | `ModelScan` at load stage |
| Awareness | Team is aware of `Prompt Injection` and supply chain |

## Level 2: Operational

The goal of Level 2 is automated control in the pipeline and runtime defense.

| Capability | Readiness Criterion |
|---|---|
| `Policy Gate` | No manual exceptions for deploy |
| Signing | All production models are signed and verified |
| `Adversarial / LLM Test` | `ART` or prompt suite with acceptance criteria runs at gate 7 |
| Runtime | `Inference Gateway`, telemetry, and tracking for FN/bypass |
| SOC | Runbook, SIEM rule, and incident SLA |

The condition for advancing to Level 3 is at least 6 months of production monitoring without critical incidents, without manual gate intervention, and a signed, verifiable evidence pack for the latest deploy.

## Level 3: Mature

The goal of Level 3 is automated audit, organizational compliance, and continuous improvement.

| Capability | Readiness Criterion |
|---|---|
| Automated evidence pack | Produced in every build without manual intervention |
| Advanced SOC | Alerts mapped and correlated to `MITRE ATLAS` |
| Tamper-evident evidence | Use of `Rekor`, `WORM`, or object lock |
| Multi-tenant / K8s | RBAC, service mesh, and multi-tenant isolation |
| Compliance | Trace from `NIST AI RMF`, `ISO 42001`, and `EU AI Act` to controls |
| Continuous improvement | Periodic red team and automated regression score |

## Minimum Starting Controls

For a practical start, these controls deliver the most value:

- Record data and model versions
- Scan secrets and dependencies
- Scan model artifacts
- Define gates that actually stop
- Sign models before release
- Record a basic evidence pack
- Monitor prompt, response, and tool call

## Recommended 90-Day Path

| Period | Focus | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 to 30 | Discovery and foundation | Threat model, asset inventory, data control |
| Day 31 to 60 | Pipeline | Security gate, scan, test, and evidence pack |
| Day 61 to 90 | Runtime | Gateway, telemetry, alert, and rollback |

## Maturity Metrics

| Metric | Sign of Maturity |
|---|---|
| Reproducibility | Model can be rebuilt with the same data and code. |
| Auditability | All release decisions have evidence. |
| Automatic stop | Gates actually fail the pipeline. |
| Runtime security | Prompt, response, retrieval, and tool call are monitored. |
| Incident response | Rollback and playbook are defined. |

## Common Mistakes on the Maturity Path

- Starting with many tools without a threat model
- Ignoring data and focusing solely on the model
- Creating gates that only warn and do not stop
- Forgetting runtime and SOC
- Manually producing evidence after an incident

## Practical Principle

`MLSecOps` maturity does not start with buying tools. It starts with understanding assets, defining threats, implementing foundational controls, and producing reliable evidence.
