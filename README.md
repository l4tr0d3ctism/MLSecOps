# MLSecOps Guide v0.1

> **An open-source operational guide for securing AI systems across the complete ML lifecycle.**

## Why MLSecOps?

AI systems introduce security risks beyond traditional software:

- Training data and dataset lineage
- Model artifacts and weights
- Prompts and system instructions
- Embeddings and vector indexes
- RAG retrieval pipelines
- AI agents and tool execution
- Probabilistic runtime behavior

`MLSecOps` extends `DevSecOps` principles to these AI-native attack surfaces—from data ingest through training, deployment, runtime monitoring, and SOC integration.

> **What this is:** An operational security guide—not a blog post or checklist. It maps threats and controls to OWASP, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001, with a 10-stage security pipeline and auditable `Evidence Pack`.
>
> **Who it is for:** Security engineers, ML engineers, MLOps teams, platform owners, and governance teams building or operating production AI systems.

| AI Supply Chain | Dataset lineage, `SBOM`/`AI-BOM`, model signing, provenance |
| Model Security | Backdoor detection, poisoning, extraction, adversarial testing |
| LLM Security | Prompt injection, jailbreak, output handling, guardrails |
| RAG Security | Retrieval poisoning, embedding risks, ACL at query time |
| Agent Security | Tool abuse, intent gates, memory poisoning, multi-agent |
| Pipeline | 10-stage security pipeline with enforceable gates |
| Runtime | Drift monitoring, inference gateway, telemetry |
| Governance | `Evidence Pack`, EU AI Act mapping, maturity roadmap |
| Operations | SOC integration, incident response, case studies |

Aligned with OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025), MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, OpenSSF MLSecOps, and CSA MAESTRO.

## MLSecOps vs DevSecOps

`DevSecOps` secures code, infrastructure, dependencies, containers, secrets, and `CI/CD`.

`MLSecOps` additionally secures data, models, prompts, embeddings, vector databases, RAG, agents, and AI runtime behavior.

| Dimension | `DevSecOps` | `MLSecOps` |
|---|---|---|
| Primary asset | Code, image, dependency | Data, model, embedding, prompt |
| Supply chain artifact | Package, container image | Model weights, dataset, vector index |
| Security testing | SAST, SCA, DAST | Adversarial test, LLM red team, backdoor scan |
| Attack surface | API, container, IaC | Inference API, RAG, agent tools, GPU memory |
| Promotion control | Build and deploy gate | Gate before train, evaluate, sign, and deploy |
| Evidence | SBOM, attestation | SBOM + `AI-BOM`, model signing, `Evidence Pack` |

`MLSecOps` does not replace `DevSecOps`—both must be integrated. See [Chapter 1](chapters-en/01-intro.md) for the full comparison.

## Project Status

**Version:** v0.1 (draft)

This project is a research-driven **operational guide**—not an official industry standard. Content is based on published frameworks and knowledge through the end of 2025. Given the pace of change in LLM and Agentic AI, readers should periodically review new versions of OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS, and related standards.

Community feedback, issues, and contributions are welcome.
