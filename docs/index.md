## Why MLSecOps?

AI systems introduce security risks beyond traditional software:

- Training data and dataset lineage
- Model artifacts and weights
- Prompts and system instructions
- Embeddings and vector indexes
- RAG retrieval pipelines
- AI agents and tool execution
- Probabilistic runtime behavior

`MLSecOps` extends `DevSecOps` principles to these AI-native attack surfaces—from data ingest through training, deployment, runtime monitoring, and SOC integration.

> **What this is:** A framework-oriented security guide—not a blog post, checklist, or certified standard. It maps threats and controls to OWASP, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001, with a 10-stage security pipeline model and an auditable `Evidence Pack` concept.
>
> **Who it is for:** Security engineers, ML engineers, MLOps teams, platform owners, and governance teams building or operating production AI systems.

| Model Security | Backdoor detection, poisoning, extraction, adversarial testing |
| LLM Security | Prompt injection, jailbreak, output handling, guardrails |
| RAG Security | Retrieval poisoning, embedding risks, ACL at query time |
| Agent Security | Tool abuse, intent gates, memory poisoning, multi-agent |
| Pipeline | 10-stage security pipeline with enforceable gates |
| Runtime | Drift monitoring, inference gateway, telemetry |
| Governance | `Evidence Pack`, EU AI Act mapping, maturity roadmap |
| Operations | SOC integration, incident response, case studies |

Aligned with OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025), MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, OpenSSF MLSecOps, and CSA MAESTRO.

## MLSecOps vs DevSecOps

`DevSecOps` secures code, infrastructure, dependencies, containers, secrets, and `CI/CD`.

`MLSecOps` additionally secures data, models, prompts, embeddings, vector databases, RAG, agents, and AI runtime behavior.

| Dimension | `DevSecOps` | `MLSecOps` |
|---|---|---|
| Primary asset | Code, image, dependency | Data, model, embedding, prompt |
| Supply chain artifact | Package, container image | Model weights, dataset, vector index |
| Security testing | SAST, SCA, DAST | Adversarial test, LLM red team, backdoor scan |
| Attack surface | API, container, IaC | Inference API, RAG, agent tools, GPU memory |
| Promotion control | Build and deploy gate | Gate before train, evaluate, sign, and deploy |
| Evidence | SBOM, attestation | SBOM + `AI-BOM`, model signing, `Evidence Pack` |

`MLSecOps` does not replace `DevSecOps`—both must be integrated. See [Chapter 1](chapters-en/01-intro.md) for the full comparison.
