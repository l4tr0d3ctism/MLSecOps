# Changelog

All notable changes to the MLSecOps Guide are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Ch.7 — Prompt injection defenses: from filters to architecture** — L0–L3 defense layers (runtime filter, instruction hierarchy, spotlighting, Dual-LLM / structural patterns, IFC/capability); citations to Wallace et al. (2024), Hines et al. (2024), Willison (2023), Debenedetti et al. CaMeL (2025), Beurer-Kellner et al. design patterns (2025), Costa et al. FIDES (2025), AgentDojo (2024).
- **Secure by design sections (Ch.1, 4, 7, 8)** — authorization- and output-channel defaults complementing the prompt-injection defense layers: assume-injection axiom and authorization-outside-the-model (Ch.1); no-direct-data-store-credentials / authorizing-service pattern (Ch.4); identity propagation with credential insulation, model-controlled-parameter constraints, intra-tenant vector-store RLS pre-filter, and zero-egress rendering (Ch.7); agent-never-selects-its-own-scope (delegated / NHI identity), credential insulation at the tool boundary, orchestrator-driven approval surface, and structurally-bounded autonomy (Ch.8); Appendix E.1.1 intra-tenant RLS access-model row and E.1.4 identity/data-access row; TOC Ch.8 title restored. Mapped to OWASP `LLM01`/`LLM02`/`LLM06`/`LLM08`, OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (`ASI02`/`ASI03`/`ASI08`/`ASI09`), OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10, RFC 8693, MITRE ATLAS, CSA AARM, and EchoLeak (`CVE-2025-32711`).
- **Tool maturity labels** (`Mature` / `Emerging` / `Research/Lab`) in Ch.11–12 MCP/gateway tables; Evidence Pack MCP control worded as capability (static scan report), not a single product name.

### Changed

- Ch.8 agent defense layers and Ch.9 anti-patterns: detect-only injection defense called out; Appendix E.1.4 / threat-model template aligned.
- Ch.15 bibliography and production checklist updated for design-level PI refs and MCP scan capability wording.

### Fixed

- **GitHub Pages / sitemap URLs** — after account rename, `site_url`, `robots.txt`, and docs links now use `https://mhaghighian.github.io/MLSecOps/` (the old `l4tr0d3ctism.github.io` host 404s and broke Search Console sitemap reads).

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **Issue #1 reference blocks restored** — expanded compacted `> *Refs - …*` lines from PR #3 back to per-section `### References / Source mapping` blocks across Chapters 1–17, keeping the corrected framework IDs and content from that review.

### Changed

- Community review merge ([PR #3](https://github.com/l4tr0d3ctism/MLSecOps/pull/3) by [@Ali-Razmjoo](https://github.com/Ali-Razmjoo)): citation fixes (ATLAS/OWASP IDs), scope clarifications, Evidence Pack / maturity wording, Stage 3 naming, Ch.6 worked example, and related chapter edits.
- **Release packaging** — PDF and DOCX are no longer attached to GitHub Releases or linked from the site; generate locally with `scripts/build-docx.py` when needed.

### Removed

- **GUIDE-SUMMARY.md** and related summary navigation/links from README, GETTING-STARTED, MkDocs, and GitHub Pages.
- Pre-built **PDF / DOCX** download links from README, Getting Started, and release pages (build script remains).

### Added

- **[references/AARM-ALIGNMENT.md](references/AARM-ALIGNMENT.md)** — complementary mapping to CSA AARM (Autonomous Action Runtime Management); links from Ch.8 and GETTING-STARTED.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Per-section traceability (Issue #1)** — `References / Source mapping` blocks on every major `##` section across Chapters 1–17; [traceability convention](chapters-en/15-conclusion-appendix.md#traceability-and-source-mapping-convention) in Ch.15; CONTRIBUTING/GOVERNANCE expectations updated.
- **OWASP AI Exchange integration** — complementary positioning and per-section source mapping where applicable: Ch.1 Exchange relationship; Ch.2 AI inventory + risk workflow; Ch.5 poisoning taxonomy + model theft paths; Ch.6 three test categories; Ch.7 augmentation data, downstream injection, verification gaps; Ch.12 periodic table cross-ref; `GETTING-STARTED.md` resource selector; Ch.15 Exchange citation.
- **Ch.1 — Why this guide matters** — explicit reader value proposition, learning outcomes, and practical takeaways ([Issue #2](https://github.com/l4tr0d3ctism/MLSecOps/issues/2)).
- **Ch.1 — Guide at a glance** — audience, goal, outputs, and scope summary after Abstract.

### Changed

- **Ch.1** — intro polish: transition sentence, split paragraphs, lifecycle lead-in, wording fixes per community review.
- **Ch.1–17** — framework source mapping audit: OWASP LLM/ML Top 10 IDs, MITRE ATLAS techniques, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, OpenSSF, and OWASP AI Exchange permalinks aligned to section topics.
- **GETTING-STARTED.md** — Quick Start (5 Minutes), *New to AI Security?* path, renamed production baseline section, *When to use this guide vs. OWASP AI Exchange*.
- **TABLE-OF-CONTENTS.md** — Ch.1 entries for *Why this guide matters* and *What this guide adds*; traceability convention; Exchange-related sections (Ch.1–2, 5–7, 12).
- **Ch.7** — removed duplicate augmentation block under Ingest security (cross-ref only).
- **Ch.12 / Ch.15 Appendix B** — MITRE ATLAS table synchronized (`AML.T0066`, `AML.T0034`).
- **Ch.13** — LangChain case study: added CVE-2025-68664 alongside CVE-2025-27520.
- **prepare_pages.py** — rewrite anchored `GETTING-STARTED.md#…` links for MkDocs; site index banner v1.1.0.
- **README.md** — OWASP AI Exchange in frameworks list; version and download links v1.1.0.
- Version strings aligned to **v1.1.0** across Ch.1, TOC, README, CITATION.cff, CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE, SECURITY, RELEASE_NOTES, and releases README.
